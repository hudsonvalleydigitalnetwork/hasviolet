# Development

This is development code approaching RELEASE CANDIDATE quality. All ESP32 development is performed with the following resources. Use at your own risk.

## ESP32 Hardware:
* [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2)](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp32/wifi_lora_32/hardware_update_log.html#v2)
as purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WHRS2XG)

## IDE Platform:
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Heltec ESP32 support](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/heltec_wifi_lora_32_V2.html) installed.


## Notes
While PlatformIO is the preferred IDE platform, you should be able to use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) with [Heltec ESP32 board/libraries](https://heltec.org/wifi_kit_install/). All code should work on any ESP32 with SX1276 LoRa module and a 0.96in OLED attached. Use at your own risk.
