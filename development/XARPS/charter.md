# Charter

XARPS expands on existing packet radio systems and initially targets the following services.

These include:

* Weather
* GPS
* Messaging
* Beacons and Bulletins

## Operating Theory 

XARPS is physical and data-link neutral focusing only on payload standards that include support of source/destination. While initially focused on single (broadcast) domain use, XARPS can be expanded to interact with other domains via XARPS aware gateways.

## XARPS Gateways

XARPS Gateways will be bastion hosts that are multi-protocol capable to other RF or Internet domains.
