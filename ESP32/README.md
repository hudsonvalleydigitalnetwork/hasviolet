# ESP32

This folder is dedicate to all resrouces for HASviolet running on ESP32. Strategic direction is for all code to be provided in source and binary releases


## Resources utilized
While best effort is made for the broadest compatibility with ESP32, OLED, and RF modules, resources below are current
reference model for production and testing of code.

### ESP32 Hardware:
* [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2)](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp32/wifi_lora_32/hardware_update_log.html#v2)
as purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WHRS2XG)


### IDE Platform:
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Heltec ESP32 support](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/heltec_wifi_lora_32_V2.html) added. (preferred)
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) with [Heltec ESP32 board/libraries](https://heltec.org/wifi_kit_install/) installed


## Development
Code under development approaching RELEASE CANDIDATE quality. Use at own risk
