# HAS violet
Project HAS Violet, brought to you by HVDN, the letter Q and numbers 8, 4 and 5. 

Do you HAS Violet?

Goal: Utilize the 900 MHz unlicensed ISM band and parrallel licensed amateur radio spectrum to enable an open source data communicator to collectively promote the usage of emerging wireless protocols via converged wireless hobbyist circles in the Hudson Valley of New York and globally. Project HAS Violet consists of the following components:

     •	Hardware
     •	Antenna
     •	Software
     
Why “HAS Violet”?

Creating an agnostic and universally appealing project name was important to create wider appeal for the project. The name of "Violet" was selected by first starting with a color and then looking for a story behind it. With all colors easily rendered by a standardized HTML CSS HEX code, the value of 8B0BB4 also translates to a decimal value of 911250. This value looks like the frequency of 911.250 MHz and thus is the main frequency to be used for the HVDN sponsored "Project HAS Violet".  The word "HAS" is a simple acronym made up of the first letter of the words "Hardware", "Antenna" and "Software". The full project name is "HAS Violet" which is as fun to say or promote its goal and use cases.

Project HAS Violet: Component Description

Three different components make up the entirety of the HAS Violet Project. They are: 

       Hardware - HAS Violet is comprised of low cost common off the shelf hardware or COTS. This approach reduced project design time   
       and created a low barrier of entry for anyone interested in the project. The initial approved hardware includes the Adafruit LoRa 
       Radio Bonnet with OLED - RFM95W @ 915MHz - RadioFruit and the Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless. Future hardware will include the 
       featherwing based form factor LoRa products in other spectrum bands that offer additional convergence of ISM and amateur radio 
       experimentation opportunities.

       Antenna - The 902 to 928 MHz ISM spectrum for unlicensed communication in ITU region 2 has a few limitations to consider.    
       Tolerance for interference from other users and maximum transmission power that creates a 50 mV/m of electrical field strength at 
       3 meters distance are what has to be considered in HAS Violet.   The Federal Communications Commission title 47 part 15 provides 
       further detail.
       
       The amateur radio service however in ITU region 2 is exempt from transmission power limitations that restrict range for    
       unlicensed users, but has to accommodate interference from other licensed or unlicensed users. In order to maintain compliance, 
       HVDN promotes the adoption of field strength measuring equipment and use of the appropriate antenna dependent on the user’s 
       frequency of 911.250 MHz with or without an amateur radio license.
       
       The HAS Violet project includes an HVDN designed directional broadband multi-frequency (433/900) ISM and amateur radio antenna to
       help create awareness of the benefits of gaining an amateur radio license for longer range communication. Unlicensed users may  
       appreciate the antenna’s ability to receive signals from further away and to show immediate value in gaining an amateur radio 
       license.
       
       Software – By assembling project HAS Violet from common off the shelf hardware, a simple software package was needed to provide  
       easy setup and use of HAS Violet.  The basic demonstrator application for HAS Violet is a text based communicator that utilizes  
       python libraries and all sorts of other crap that my collaborators will elaborate on.  The overall goal though, is to make an 
       image that is easy to deploy and get up and running very quickly.
